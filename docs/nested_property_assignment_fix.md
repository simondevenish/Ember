# EmberScript Nested Property Assignment Fix

## Issue Summary

In EmberScript, we encountered an issue with nested property assignment (e.g., `obj.x.y = value`) where:

1. The AST interpreter implementation successfully handled nested property assignments
2. The VM implementation failed with an error when trying to process nested property paths

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had different characteristics in the two execution environments:

### AST Interpreter
In `runtime.c`, the interpreter has direct access to the full AST structure of the property assignment. This allows it to:
- Access the complete property path
- Navigate nested objects recursively
- Apply changes at any depth

### VM Implementation
In `virtual_machine.c`, the VM uses a stack-based approach where:
- Operations (get property, set property) work on individual stack elements
- No inherent mechanism to track multi-level property paths
- Property assignments expect the property name to be a string

## Solution Implemented

We implemented two complementary solutions:

### 1. Documentation and Coding Pattern

Created a clear workaround pattern that works reliably in both execution modes:

```js
// Instead of:
obj.x.y = "value";

// Use:
var inner = obj.x;
inner.y = "value";
obj.x = inner;
```

This approach:
- Works in both AST interpreter and VM modes
- Is clear and easy to understand
- Maintains object references (no unnecessary copying)

### 2. VM Improvements (Partial)

Made improvements to the VM to better handle special cases:
- Added helper functions for property access (`vm_get_property`)
- Added helper functions for property assignment (`vm_set_property_at_path`)
- Added special handling for property values that are objects

## Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/object_properties.md` - User-facing guide on working with objects
- `docs/nested_property_assignment_fix.md` - Technical explanation of the issue and fix
- Example scripts demonstrating both approaches:
  - `test_scripts/simple_nested_property.ember` - Basic example
  - `test_scripts/nested_property_demo.ember` - Comprehensive demo

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
1. Implement full nested property path handling in the VM
2. Add a specific opcode for nested property assignment
3. Optimize the bytecode generated for nested property access
4. Consider a different compilation strategy for deeply nested properties

## Conclusion

The current solution provides a reliable workaround that:
- Works consistently across all execution modes
- Is easy for developers to adopt
- Doesn't require significant changes to the VM architecture
- Maintains compatibility with existing code
